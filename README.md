# Installation

1. Copy daily-summary.php and the /daily-summary folder into the /plugins directory of your Zenphoto installation.
2. Rename daily-summary.php.sample-theme to daily-summary.php and copy it into your current Zenphoto theme folder.
3. Enable the 'daily-summary' plugin in the Zenphoto backend.
4. Navigate to yourzenphotoaddress.com/?p=daily-summary and you will now see a page summarising the recently uploaded images from your gallery.

Note: you will probably need to edit the daily-summary.php.sample-theme theme file to match the look and feel of our current Zenphoto theme.
